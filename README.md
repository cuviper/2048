# ±64
A derivative of [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/), which is a small clone of [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), based on [Saming's 2048](http://saming.fr/p/2048/) (also a clone).

The twist is the addition of negative numbers.

Made just for fun. [Play it here!](http://cuviper.github.io/pm64/)
